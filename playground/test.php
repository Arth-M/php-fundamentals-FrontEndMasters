<?php
// CLI 'php test.php' will launch the code in your terminal

//this is a single line commentary

$name = "Arthuro";
echo "Hello world";

echo("Hello woorld!");
echo $name;

/* this is a multiline
commentary */
?>

// comments does not work outside '<?php ?> ' tags as it is considered an output


 So you can also write output outside of php tags ! Be careful when writing scripts not to add
 spaces or anything after the closing tag that you don't want to be part of the output!
